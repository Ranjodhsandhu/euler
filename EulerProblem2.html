<h1>Euler Problem 2</h1>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
</br>
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
</br>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

<p>Answer is: <em>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        let sum = 0;
        let term1 = 0;
        let term2 = 1;
        let currentTerm = 0;
        while(currentTerm < 4000000){
            currentTerm = term1 + term2; 
            term1 = term2;
            term2 = currentTerm;
            if(currentTerm % 2 === 0){
                sum = sum + currentTerm;
            }
        }
        document.write(sum);
    </script>
    </em></p>
